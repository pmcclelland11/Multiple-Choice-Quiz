# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 4 Challenge
## Multiple Choice Quiz
Simple application that can be used to randomly generate a password (between 8-127) with custom character criteria. For this assignment, we were provided with the HTML and CSS source code, as well as the beginning of a JavaScript file that will be used to generate a random password for the user. We were required to write a function named generatePassword() that can perform this task. This assignment tested my knowledge of basic JavaScript and interacting with HTML elements.
