# UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp - Module 4 Challenge
## Multiple Choice Quiz
A simple quiz application created from HTML/CSS/JavaScript, that tests the user's knowledge of HTML. The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. If the user answers a question correctly, they gain 1 point. If they guess wrong, then 10 seconds is deduced from the time remaining. Utilizing localStorage, the user is able to store their initials and score into a highscore record - which is viewable after completing the quiz.
